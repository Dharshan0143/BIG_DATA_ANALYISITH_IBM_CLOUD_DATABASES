# Data Ingestion

In the context of our big data analysis project, data ingestion is the crucial process of importing external datasets into our chosen database system within the IBM Cloud environment. This step is fundamental in preparing the data for further analysis, ensuring that it is readily available for our data scientists and analysts.

## Steps for Data Ingestion

1. **Data Source Selection**: The first step in data ingestion is to identify and select the appropriate data sources. This might involve various data formats, such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or data from external APIs. We need to understand our data sources and their structures to effectively import them into our database.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Before ingestion, it's essential to perform any necessary data preprocessing. This can include tasks like data cleaning, removing duplicates, and transforming data to the desired format.

3. **Database Connection**: Establish a connection to the IBM Cloud database where you intend to store the data. This connection typically requires database credentials and connection parameters. It's important to ensure that the database instance is up and running.

4. **Data Loading**: Develop data ingestion scripts, such as `data_ingestion.py`, to import the selected dataset into the database. These scripts should handle the data transfer process and ensure that the data is properly loaded.

5. **Validation**: After loading the data, perform validation checks to ensure that the data is correctly transferred and matches the original source data.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the data ingestion process. This helps in identifying issues and errors, and it provides a record of the ingestion history.

7. **Schedule and Automation**: Depending on the project requirements, consider scheduling regular data ingestion processes or automating the process when new data becomes available.

## Sample Data Ingestion Script

Here's a simplified example of a Python script for data ingestion (`data_ingestion.py`):

```python
import pandas as pd
import ibm_db
import ibm_db_dbi

# Define your dataset file path
dataset_file = "Data/external_data/sample_data.csv"

# Database connection details
db_credentials = {
    "host": "your-database-host",
    "db": "your-database-name",
    "user": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
}

# Establish a connection to the database
conn_str = (
    f"DATABASE={db_credentials['db']};HOSTNAME={db_credentials['host']};"
    f"PORT={db_credentials['port']};PROTOCOL=TCPIP;"
    f"UID={db_credentials['user']};PWD={db_credentials['password']};"
)

try:
    conn = ibm_db.connect(conn_str, "", "")
    print("Connected to the database.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unable to connect to the database: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(dataset_file)

    # Insert the DataFrame into the database
    dbi_conn = ibm_db_dbi.Connection(conn)
    df.to_sql("your_table_name", dbi_conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)

    print("Data successfully ingested into the database.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error ingesting data: {e}")

finally:
    # Close the database connection
    ibm_db.close(conn)
    print("Database connection closed.")
