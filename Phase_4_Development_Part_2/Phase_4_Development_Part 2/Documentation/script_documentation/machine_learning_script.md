# Machine Learning Script Documentation

## Script Overview

This document provides documentation for the machine learning script used in the big data analysis project's Phase 4. The script is designed to apply machine learning algorithms to the dataset and extract valuable insights.

## Usage

To use the machine learning script, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries like scikit-learn.

2. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess your dataset as needed.

3. **Script Execution**: Run the `machine_learning.py` script.

## Output
The script generates the following outputs:
`Machine Learning Model Accuracy: 0.85`

## Parameters
dataPath: `phase_4_Development Part 1\Data\processed_data\cleaned_data.csv`
