## Introduction

Welcome to Phase 4 of our Big Data Analysis Project! In this phase, we continue building the project, focusing on advanced analysis techniques and visualizing the results. Our objective is to apply more complex analysis methods, such as machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, or sentiment analysis, depending on our dataset and project objectives. Additionally, we will create visualizations to effectively showcase the insights gained from our analysis. This README provides an overview of this phase and guides you through the project structure.

## Analysis Scripts

In this section, you will find Python scripts for advanced analysis techniques. These scripts are designed to extract valuable insights from the data. The analysis scripts include:

- `machine_learning.py`: This script contains machine learning algorithms tailored to our dataset and project goals.
- `time_series_analysis.py`: Use this script for time series analysis.
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: This script focuses on sentiment analysis.

## Visualizations

The Visualizations section is dedicated to creating graphical representations of our analysis results. These visualizations effectively communicate the insights gained from the advanced analysis techniques. The visualizations are organized into subdirectories:

- `advanced_analysis_results/` contains subdirectories for different analysis techniques, such as machine learning, time series analysis, and sentiment analysis.
- `visualizations.py` is the main script for creating graphical representations.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for clarity and sharing insights with stakeholders. We have provided script documentation for each analysis script, as well as documentation for our visualizations. The documentation includes:

- `script_documentation/`: Contains separate markdown files for each analysis script.
- `visualization_documentation.md`: This markdown file explains the visualizations and how to interpret them.

## Data

Data is at the heart of our analysis. In this section, you will find:

- `data_used_for_analysis/`: This directory houses the data used for advanced analysis.
- `cleaned_datasets/`: Contains any cleaned datasets required for this phase.

## File System Structure

Here is the proposed file system structure that aligns with the key components of Phase 4:
