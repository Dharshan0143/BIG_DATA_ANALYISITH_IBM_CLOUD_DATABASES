# Database Instance Setup

## Introduction
This document outlines the process of setting up a database instance within IBM Cloud for our big data analysis project. The database instance serves as the central repository for our datasets, providing a scalable and secure environment for storage and management.

## Database Service
Before we proceed with the setup, we've already selected the appropriate database service, as detailed in the "Database_Service.md" document. Ensure that the chosen service is available and accessible within your IBM Cloud account.

## Database Instance Creation
To create the database instance, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to IBM Cloud:** Use your IBM Cloud account credentials to log in at [https://cloud.ibm.com/](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

2. **Access the IBM Cloud Dashboard:** Navigate to your IBM Cloud Dashboard, which provides an overview of your resources and services.

3. **Create a Database Instance:**
   - Click on the "Create Resource" button.
   - Search for the selected database service.
   - Select the database service from the catalog.
   - Configure the database instance by specifying details such as name, location, storage, and access controls.
   - Review and confirm the configuration.

4. **Provision the Database Instance:** Once your instance configuration is confirmed, IBM Cloud will provision the database instance.

5. **Access the Database:** After provisioning is complete, you'll receive connection details and credentials to access the database instance.

## Configuration and Access
With the database instance set up, you can now proceed to configure it further and access it for data management and analysis.

## Conclusion
The successful setup of the database instance marks an important milestone in our big data analysis project. This instance will be instrumental in storing and managing the extensive datasets that we'll be analyzing.

Next, we'll move on to recording the process of ingesting our dataset, which is documented in the "Data_Ingestion.md" file. This step is crucial for populating our database with the data we intend to analyze.
