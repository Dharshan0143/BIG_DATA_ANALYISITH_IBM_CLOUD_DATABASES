# Phase 3: Data Analysis and Database Setup

Welcome to Phase 3 of our Big Data Analysis project. In this phase, we delve into the data analysis process and set up the database instance to store and manage our extensive datasets. This document provides an overview of Phase 3 and describes the contents of the various files within this phase.

## File Structure
The Phase 3 directory is structured as follows:

- `Database_Service.md`: This document outlines our selection of the appropriate database service for our project, based on key considerations. It also provides information on the chosen database service's features and benefits.

- `Database_Instance.md`: Here, we document the setup of the database instance within IBM Cloud. This instance is vital for storing and managing our datasets, and this document describes the steps taken to create and configure it.

- `Data_Exploration.md`: This document focuses on the data exploration and basic analysis phase. It provides insights into the dataset's structure, initial findings, and any statistical summaries or visualizations generated.

- `Data_Cleaning.md`: In this document, we record the data cleaning and transformation phase, addressing data quality issues, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset as needed.

- `README.md` (This File): You are currently reading the overview of Phase 3 and the file descriptions within this phase.

## Next Steps
Phase 3 marks a pivotal stage in our project, where we set up the database instance and prepare our dataset for advanced analysis. Following this phase, we will proceed to advanced analysis techniques and visualization to uncover valuable insights.
