# Data Exploration and Basic Analysis

## Introduction
This document records the data exploration and basic analysis phase of our big data analysis project using IBM Cloud Databases. During this phase, we aim to understand the structure and content of our datasets, identify patterns, and gain initial insights.

## Data Source
Before diving into data exploration, it's essential to mention the source of the dataset we are working with. Briefly describe the dataset and its origin.

## Data Exploration
1. **Dataset Overview:**
   - Provide a high-level overview of the dataset, including its size, format, and the number of records.

2. **Data Inspection:**
   - Describe the process of loading the dataset into our database instance.
   - Check the first few records to get a sense of the data's structure and content.

3. **Statistical Summary:**
   - Generate basic statistics about the dataset, such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
   - Calculate the frequency distribution for categorical variables.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create simple data visualizations, such as histograms, bar charts, or scatter plots, to explore data distribution and relationships.

5. **Initial Findings:**
   - Document any initial insights or observations gained from the data exploration. This might include data anomalies, trends, or patterns.

## Basic Analysis
1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - If applicable, perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Determine which features (columns) are relevant for our analysis and should be retained.

3. **Data Cleansing:**
   - Identify any data quality issues, such as missing values or outliers.
   - Describe how you plan to handle these issues.

4. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - If relevant to your analysis, outline any hypotheses to be tested in this phase.

## Next Steps
After completing the data exploration and basic analysis, the next steps may include data cleaning and transformation, advanced analysis techniques, and visualization.

## Conclusion
The data exploration and basic analysis phase is a fundamental step in our big data analysis project. It equips us with a foundational understanding of the dataset and initial insights that will guide our further analysis.

Refer to the "Data_Cleaning.md" document for details on data cleaning and transformation, which is the next phase in our project.
