# Data Cleaning and Transformation

## Introduction
This document records the data cleaning and transformation phase of our big data analysis project using IBM Cloud Databases. During this phase, we focus on preparing the data for analysis by addressing data quality issues, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset as needed.

## Data Cleaning
1. **Identify Data Quality Issues:**
   - List any data quality issues identified during the data exploration phase, such as missing values, duplicate records, or outliers.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Describe the strategies employed to handle missing values, including techniques like imputation, removal, or other approaches.

3. **Duplicate Records:**
   - Explain how duplicate records are identified and managed in the dataset.

4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**
   - If applicable, describe how outliers are detected and treated to ensure they don't adversely impact the analysis.

## Data Transformation
1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Detail any feature engineering techniques applied to create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the analysis.

2. **Data Normalization or Scaling:**
   - If necessary, explain the process of normalizing or scaling data to ensure all variables have the same scale.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
   - Describe how categorical variables are encoded, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. **Data Aggregation:**
   - If relevant to your analysis, explain any data aggregation performed to group data at a higher level.

5. **Date and Time Parsing:**
   - Detail how date and time information is parsed and converted into usable formats.

6. **Handling Text Data:**
   - If your dataset contains text data, document any text preprocessing steps, such as tokenization, stemming, or sentiment analysis.

## Quality Assurance
1. **Data Validation:**
   - Explain the steps taken to validate the cleaned and transformed dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Describe how errors or inconsistencies encountered during data cleaning and transformation are handled.

## Next Steps
After completing the data cleaning and transformation phase, you can proceed with advanced data analysis, which may involve statistical techniques, machine learning models, or other methods to uncover insights from the prepared dataset.

## Conclusion
Data cleaning and transformation are critical steps in our big data analysis project, as they ensure the dataset is in a suitable form for further analysis. By addressing data quality issues and transforming the data as needed, we set the foundation for more advanced analysis techniques.
